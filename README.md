# SmartGPT

I've been working on a project that I'm excited to share with this community. It's called SmartGPT, a tool that extends the capabilities of GPT-4 by generating and analyzing multiple responses to enhance the quality of the final output.

When you ask SmartGPT a question, it generates several responses, identifies their strengths and weaknesses, and then refines these observations into a more accurate and comprehensive answer. It's essentially like giving GPT-4 an opportunity to brainstorm before settling on a final response.

The idea was inspired by a YouTube video that discussed potential ways to improve the performance of GPT models. Here's the link if you're interested: YouTube video.
